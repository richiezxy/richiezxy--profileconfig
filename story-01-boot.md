In the first hour before dawn, the temple did not rise from stone.
It rose from terminal light.

The ritual sandbox opened in silence.
No foreign realm write-targets detected.
Only a dark console, a blinking prompt, and one line:

The keepers called it normal.
The wind-song of the kernel had accepted us.

The circle was not complete yet, but it was listening.
