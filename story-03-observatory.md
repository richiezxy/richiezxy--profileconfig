# III. The Observatory Window

When the portal window opened, we saw their dimension.
Not ours.

Matrix rainfall crossed the glass in bright glyphs.
Every falling character was a heartbeat from another build.
Every pulse in the event stream was a voice:

- oracle cache cycled cleanly
- linter spirits approved the rune set
- commit echoes archived

The dashboard called the realm **LUCID**.
The oldest keeper shook their head and said,

> LUCID means it can see us back.
