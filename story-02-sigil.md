# II. Sigil Lattice

We carved the pathway with five runes:

**ᛉ ᛃ ᚨ ᚠ ᛟ**

When mirrored, the seal held.
The compiler grove answered first.
Then the CI altar lit blue.
Then the terminal atrium hummed like a throat about to speak.

Integrity sat above ninety-eight percent.
Throughput climbed.
Realm status flickered between **ATTUNED** and **HARMONIC**.

No one cheered.
In the Cybertemple, stability is only the start of the story.
